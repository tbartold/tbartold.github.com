 It was published as a series of 71 booklets describing the 71 coats-of-arms on the ceiling of one of the rooms in the castle in Kornik plus 2 additional booklets with introductory material and with an index of surnames. The texts were selected by Jerzy Wislocki, Ryszard Marciniak and Stanislaw Potocki from historical armorials and other sources. The illustrations are by Jiri Necas, a Czech artist living in Poznan. The series was published in the years 1988-1991 and is still available both as individual arms booklets and a two volume bound set from Biblioteka Kornicka (Kornik Library, Polish Academy of Sciences).

 The above text is taken from a message posted by Rafal Prinke [rafalp (at) amu.edu.pl] on the HERBARZ-L mailing list.

 <p>To subscribe to the mailing list, which deals with polish nobility and heraldry, write to: <b>HERBARZ-L-request (at) rootsweb.com</b> and use the word <b>subscribe</b> as the subject.</p>

 <p>The image is intentionally blurred/compressed mainly to save disk space (and to avoid infringing on the copyright). The images on the pamphlets are better quality, and are generally 3.5 to 4 inches (about 9-10 cm) tall. I originally had the complete set posted here, but was unaware that the book was still in print. I have removed them pending permission from the Library to repost them.</p>

 <h4><a href="http://www.bkpan.poznan.pl/">Biblioteka Kornika</a></h4>The Kornik Castle is located near Poznan, and you can visit its website above. Unfortunately they do not yet have information about their publications on the website.

 <p>Hopefully I will get information from the Kornik on how you can order the pamphlets, and will post that here.</p>

 <h4><a href="http://hum.amu.edu.pl/~rafalp/english.html">Rafal Prinke's Home Page</a></h4>Rafal has quite a lot of information on heraldry and genealogy, and has also written a wonderful book for amatuer genealogist. Unfortunately the book is hard to find, and is only in polish, but is a wonderful source for any amatuer polish genealogist. I will post more information here later, for those who are interested.

 <h4>Other Links</h4>I'm sorry to disappoint those coming here looking for for dipictions of arms, but here's a few links where you can find similar stuff.

 <h4><a href="http://www.polonium.de/herby/docs/index.html">Rycerskie HERBY Polaków</a></h4>POLONIUM in Germany has extensive images along with the possibility to find family names associated with the Polish arms.

 <h4><a href="http://akromer.republika.pl/herby_szlach_alfab.html">HERBY SZLACHECKIE from Adam Kromer</a></h4>This site has an extensive collecion of polish arms, although just images, and no information.
