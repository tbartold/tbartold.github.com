 <h2>Bartold's in America</h2>

 <p>OK, if this is supposed to be a Polish/American page... where's the stuff on America? Well, I don't have much, but here's something interesting...</p>

 <h3>Haller's Army</h3>

 <p>An estimated 20,000 Polish persons answered the call to fight for freedom and the opportunity to regain Poland's independence during World War I in the Polish Army in France (in Polish, Armia Polska we Francyi). They were recruited from among the Polish immigrants who came to America to fight with France while America was still neutral.</p>

 <p>The Polish Army in France was also called "Haller's Army," after the general who commanded it, or the "Blue Army," for the blue uniforms the soldiers wore.</p>

 <p>The following Bartold's answered the call:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>Adolf from Everett MA</li>

  <li>Damazy from Detroit MI</li>

  <li>Franciszek from Philadelphia PA</li>

  <li>Julian from Detroit MI</li>

  <li>Waclaw from Wilmington DE</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Unfortunately, this is all the information I have to date, and these individuals do not connect into my other current research.</p>

 <p>For more information, see:</p>
