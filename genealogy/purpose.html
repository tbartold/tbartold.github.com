 <h1 align="center">The Purpose of this Center</h1>
 <hr />

 <h2>Purpose</h2>This site is intended as a gathering place for all information on the Bartold Surname in all its forms anywhere in the world. Currently the majority of the information I have here deals with the Bartold extended family in Poland, and especially in the Ciechanow province (north of Warsaw). The Bartold family traces its origins back to the early days of the kingdom of Poland, with the earliest references in the 13th-15th centuries. The family probably arrived from Germany, then part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Bartold name occurs throughout Europe, but is uncommon, and it is likely that the majority of Bartold's around the world today can trace their ancestry back to a common progenitor, probably a knight or nobleman in the empire in the 10th century. Thus we have the goal of this Resource Center, to collect and analyze data from around the world to find connections between us all, and hopefully to find our common ancestor.

 <h2>The Primary Goals of this Site:</h2>

 <ol>
  <li>To list all our "cousins" researching this surname.</li>

  <li>To link to all sites of interest to people researching this surname.</li>

  <li>To collect all information pertaining to this surname, and the bearers of this surname that might in some way facilitate research of this surname.</li>

  <li>To present this information on the web so that it can be freely accessed by any of our cousins at any time, from any place.</li>
 </ol>
