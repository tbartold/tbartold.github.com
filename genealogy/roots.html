<h2>My Polish Roots</h2>
<p>This is a launching page for my personal links to Polish families that I am researching. The idea, for now, is to create a tree from each set of my great-grandparents down, with any information I've been able to collect on them. I have, obviously, four sets of great-grandparents, and that's where I begin. Links to the four family pages are at the bottom of this page.
<p>Let me start by detailing my connections back to my great-grandparents, all of whom were born in the territory of what is now Poland, and six out of eigth of them remained there. Two of my great-grandparents emigrated to the USA, although neither ever became a citizen of the USA.
<p>My grandprents all considered themselves to be Polish, although one as born in the USA and the other three all emmigrated to the USA. All of them eventually became citizens of the USA, except for, the one who was born there. I explain this further on the Wojcinski page.

<p>What I am working on now is trying to identify all of the descendandt of my great grandparents. That is what folows on the pages linked below.
<p>I am currently using genealogy software called <a href="https://gramps-project.org/introduction-WP/">Gramps</a> which is one of the few programs avaialable on Linux/Ubuntu. Online I have been building the family tree at <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/">FamilySearch</a> and <a href="https://www.geni.com/">me on Geni</a> and <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Thomas-Bartold/6000000031869112730">Geni</a>, sine they are both free. I was using MyHeritage some time ago, since it was free for small trees, but my tree grew too big, and I deleted it from there. Recently, I've decided to pay for the service so I'm rebuilding my tree there <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/site-245381601/bartold">MyHeritage</a>.
The big advantage of Geni and FamilySearch, in my opinion, is that they have single instances of all individuals. We all share one big family tree. With MyHeritage, there are multiple instances of each indivdual, and you need to match them with the same individual in other trees.
I have also mostly been using <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/">FamilySearch</a> to locate records for my tree in USA. I used to use it to view records from Poland, but those are not searchable. For searches in Poland I manly use <a href="http://geneteka.genealodzy.pl/index.php">genealodzy</a>. Most of my searches for the Bartold and Nałęcz are in Mazowieckie, while Muszyński, Jurasz, and Sibilski are in Łódźkie. With Wojcinski there are problems going back. Marcin came from Wielkopolski, but those records are not available anywhere, although many marriage records are indexed at the <a href="http://poznan-project.psnc.pl/search.php">Poznan Project</a>. Also Marcin's second wife, Franciszka, my great-grandmother, seems to have been hiding her identity, her family name might have been either Szyszka, Jankowska or something else, and I am unsure where she came from. She may have been from Rypin, which is in Kujawsko-Pomorskie.

<p>Here is the information that I have collected on myheritage.com. Unfortunately, because I initially created my account in Poland, any printout I create uses Polish words and months.
