I'm writing to you about very sad news.  My mother left the world andleft us orphans this February 1st.  She was sick all year.  Half a yearshe lay in bed.  We had to watch her like a small child.  I still havepain in my hand.  It was very hard for me, I had to work every day.Sister Rosalie didn't send help to me.  Neighbors brought help to me.Ten days we sat by mother.  I was left a poor orphan without care.  Nowsister Rosalie is taking to court licitation.  It will come that we willstay in our place, which neither of us will leave and someday  strangewill leave.  Now dear sister I'm asking for your sympathy and humbly askyou for some money.  There was a bad harvest, flood and there is nopotatoes at all.  Now dear sister I got a letter from you duringChristmas.  I got everything that you sent us.  I had enough money forthe funeral.  God thank you for your good heart.  We had pleasure becauseof our son because he chose a good profession.  God will help him to lastthere.  Mother was very happy about it and said goodbye to everybody whenshe was dying and asked to be remembered and also anniversary of herdeath.  Before her death mother said goodbye to everyone but I was alonewith her when she died.  Now there will be an execution the 2nd ofMarch.  Now I say hello to everyone and goodbye.
