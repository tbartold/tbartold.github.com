I was left a poor orphan without care. Nowsister Rosalie is taking to court licitation. It will come that we willstay in our place, which neither of us will leave and someday strangewill leave. Now dear sister I'm asking for your sympathy and humbly askyou for some money. There was a bad harvest, flood and there is nopotatoes at all. Now dear sister I got a letter from you duringChristmas. I got everything that you sent us. I had enough money forthe funeral. God thank you for your good heart. We had pleasure becauseof our son because he chose a good profession.
