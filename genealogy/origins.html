 <h1 align="center">BARTOLD/BERTHOLD/PERAHTOLD: Where did it come from?</h1>This a work that might be called "Bertold Spotting", since I'm 
working from 
sightings of the name in the High Middle Ages, and trying to work out the family origins from there. <b>Note:</b> For simplicity, I am spelling the name "Bertold" here although it also appears as "Berthold" and "Berchtold", especially in German texts. I have seen instances where the same person's name was spelled all three ways.

 <h2>Warning</h2>This is a work in progress that has loads of data, repeated a few times, and not organized too well. The formatting of the paragraphs is also horid since I am editing this in a text editor and not an HTML editor.

 <h2>Short Summary</h2>The name (as an origin of the families) seems to be in Bodensee in northern Switzerland, or Friuli in north eastern 
Italy before 700 AD.

<p>The first mention of a Bartold was probably the one who was involved in the founding of Reichenau in 724. He was probably born around 687. 
His son was Alaholf, the origin of the Alaholfinger line. The family rose in the Carolingian Empire to possess lands in not only Alemannia, but Bavaria, Franconia, and Italy. 
Alaholf had a son Chadaloh (or Chrodhoh), who had a son Berthold. However, the 
earliest form of the name may have been closer to Perahthold, or Perahtoldus, which is the name often given to him where Chadaloh is mentioned. 
He was the father of a second Chadaloh, who was appointed the duke of Friuli by Charlemagne. He died in 819. 

<p>The first Bartold mentioned above was known to Charles Martel, the grandfather of Charlemagne, at least at the founding of Riechenau. It is 
possible that Bertold's father was Gottfried of Alemannia, who died in 709. Gottfied fought against Pepin of Heristal, as did Bertchar of 
Neustria. Gottfied had a son Huoching who would have been a contemporary of Berthold. Huoching's son Hnabi is often 
cited as the founder of the Aholfings, although it seems more likely that Bethold's sone Alaholf was.<p>I have to wonder if Huoching was 
another name for Bertold, and his som Hnabi was also called Alahof. Hnabi was one of the joint founders of Riechenau, along with Bertold.

 <p>Around 840 AD, the name moves back to Swabia, generally a region encompassing the current junction of Germany, France and Switzerland. The 
name really comes to the fore around 910 AD, both in Swabia, and in Bavaria, or more precisely in some of the oldest cities in Bavaria, specifically Regensburg. The name disappears in Swabia before 920. By 940 the name moves into the backround in Bavaria.</p>

 <p>The name reappears in Swabia around 980 AD, and becomes one branch of the "von Zahringen" family. There is no record of a direct link to the earlier family, but a link is very very likely. The name reappears in Bavaria in Upper Isar (south west of Munich), and becomes known as the "von Andechs". A third line resurfaces in the "East Mark" of Bavaria, known today as Austria, as part of the "von Babenberg" line.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, the last Bertold "von Zahringen" dies in 1218 and the last Bertold "von Andechs" dies in 1251.</p>

 <p>Luckily a new Bertold line surfaces around 1100 in Henneberg, in Thuringia. It is actually decended from both the "von Zahringen" (by way of a of Bertold "von Hohenburg") and the "von Andechs" lines. Bertold von Hohenburg, who was the grandson of Duke Bertold III von Zahringen had a daughter Sopie. Bertold von Wurzburg, who was the grandson of Count Bertold V von Andechs had a son Poppo. Sophie and Poppo naturally name their first son Bertold, and his grandson Bertold expanded the castle in the city of Schleusingen (in Henneberg in Thuringia) in 1284 and chose it as his home. Thus it caries the name "Bertoldsburg", and it was where a long line of Bertold's (and Poppo's) lived though 1583. (As an aside: he died in 1340 in Schmalkalden, the same city where Martin Luther died).</p>

 <p>There is also a Bertold "von Graisbach" line that runs from about 1200-1330, but I have not really looked into this line yet. It appears to descent from Liutpold's grandson Bertold (through Arnulf the Bad) who was father to Henry of Schweinfurt. The first Bartold from Graisbach would be the 8 x great-grandson of Bertold. Strange that the name resurfaced, so it's likely that his mother or grandmother was from another Bertold line.</p>

 <p>Finally there are a few other Bertold's who appear in the 1100-1300 period (Vohburg, Bogen, Tyrol, ...) that may be members of one of the lines who was named as count of one of the families holdings. <b>Note:</b> Graisbach, Bogen and Vohburg all lie in the Danube Valley in Bavaria, not far from Regensberg. This is generally the center of the Nordgau region that the Bavarian lords ruled over in the middle ages. Tyrol genearaly includes the source of the Isar River (Upper Isar), and also the city of Innsbruck (at the source of the River Inn), the sources of both rivers lie on the north side of the same mountains in Western Austria. It is known that the Bertold line in Andechs founded the city of Innsbruck (among others).</p>

 <h2>General Background</h2>My research started by trying to find where the name originated in Poland, but that turned into a dead end. The best I could find was an entry stating that there was a noble named Woiciech Bartold in 1420 in Mazowsze.

 <p>Later I discovered that the name in the form Bertoldus actually was mentioned in Poland as early as 1173. This lead me to look to Germany for the source of the name, and perhaps in the Nobles of that day. I also found a reference to the name possibly coming from "Turyngji" or "ksiazat Andecenski". The first was obviuosly the region of Turingia in Germany, but the next "prince Andecenski" seemed to be a family name. But I have had trouble locating the name in Thuringia that long ago, and I could find no Noble in Poland with the name Andecenski.</p>

 <p>As an aside... the "-ski" ending, generally when referring to a family in Poland, is used as an adjective indicating the town or profession the person had. One of the most common Polish names is Kowalski. But "kowal" is the polish word for a black smith. Thus the family of the village black smith was often refered to as "kowalski". Later it became a surname. This is similar to the origin of the Surname "Smith" in England.</p>

 <h2>Variations</h2>

 <p>I just recently came across a refernce to the name "Bertold" when I was looking for saints. It turned out that St. Hedwig who became the Princess of Silesia, and the Patron saint of that part of Poland, was the daughter of a German Count "Bertold von Andechs". Finally I found the Andecenski's! It was actually the polish name for that region of Germany. Saint Hedwig, the Duchess of Silesia (1174 - 15 Oct 1243). Unfortunately, I tend to doubt the name came to Poland throght that union. Hedwig did not name any of her sons Bertold.</p>

 <p>I've just begun looking into the origins of the name, so bear with me, more information will appear here as I find and organize it.</p>

 <p>I've just come accross a wonderful encyclopedia for doing just what I'm trying to do here: catalog the early history and spread of a name. The encyclopedia is the: "Index Bio-Bibliographicus Notorum Hominum" or the index of biographical, and bibliographic references to the names of real persons. It's sort of a multi-lingual reference, and I haven't used it in any depth yet, but for my purposes I have only looked at volumes 13 and 17. I have no idea how many volumes there are! Volume 13 covers "Bartels - Baure" and volume 17 covers "Bernstein - Bickersteht", so you guess how many volumes there might be.</p>

 <p>On page 6901 (in volume 17) there is a list of variations on the name, where "Bertoldus" is considered the base (Latin?) form:</p>
 <pre>
barthold -i -us -y !
bartold -i -o -us
berchold -us
berchtold -e
berchtoldt
berchtoldus
berchtolt
berichtolt
bertald -o -us !
bergol'dt (iso)
berthaldus
Bertold -e -i
Bertoldt
Bertoldus
bertholt
bertoaldus !
bertold -i -o
bertoldt
bertoldus
bertolo
bertolt
! - frequently confused with:
bernaldus
bernoldus
bernoul
beroaldus
bertrandus
</pre>

 <p>Now if this weren't enough, each listing may refer you to diferent versions of a given name. For instance: Bertoldus, who was king of the Saxons and Frisians around 630 A.D. is also refered to as: Beroaldus, Berthuld, Bertoald, Bertoul, Berwald, and Bertwaldus.</p>

 <h2>Early Occurance of the Name</h2>This first <b>Bertold</b> King of the Saxons died in 633. However the name Bertold does not reappear in the subsequent Kings nor the Dukes under the Frankish empire. However the name Bartoldus still occurs in the Netherlands, where the Frisians settled.

 <p>The rulers of the Saxons were:</p>
 <pre>
Wingils
Witta
Hengest, Prince of the Jutes (- 488)
Hartwake, Prince of the Saxons
Haqthwigate, Prince of the Saxons
Hulderich, König der Sachsen
Bodicus, (Budic) Prinz der Sachsen
Bertwald, König der Sachsen (- 633)
Sighard, (Sigismund) König der Sachsen
Dieterick, (Theodorus) König der Sachsen (675 - 740)
Werniche, (Warnechin, Werner) König von Sachsen (700 - 768)
Widukind, (Wittikind) König der Sachsen ( - 810)
</pre>The saxons were finally subjugated in 804 by Charlemagne, who had been crowned Emperor in 800.

 <h3>Other earliest occurances</h3>
 <pre>
There are quite a few more that I will add later.
Here we have the earliest reference I've located so far...
Bertaldus (sanctus) [(- 541 (16 june) sacerdos et eremita gallus cum amando]
but I have yet to translate it.
Bertoaldus (- c. 590) mayor of Palais
Bertoaldus/Bertoldus/Bertwaldus (-aft. 627 13. oct) bishop of cambrai
Bertoaldus (bef. 628-650) bishop (langres 628)?
Bertoldus (bef. 656-662) bishop gaul (troyes 656)
Bertwald (bef. 690 - 729) archbishop of Canterbury
</pre>This last <b>Bertwald/Bertold</b> occurs in <b><i>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles</i></b>. He was the first saint I have found with the name and he was the first archbishop in England who was not a Roman. The Chronicles give us these references to Bertwald:

 <p>A.D. 690. <i>This year Archbishop Theodore, who had been bishop twenty-two winters, departed this life, and was buried within the city of Canterbury. <b>Bertwald</b>, who before this was abbot of Reculver, on the calends of July succeeded him in the see; which was ere this filled by Romish bishops, but henceforth with English.</i></p>

 <p>A.D. 693. <i>This year was Bertwald consecrated archbishop by Godwin, bishop of the Gauls, on the fifth day before the nones of July.</i></p>

 <p>A.D. 729. <i>This year appeared the comet-star... Archbishop Bertwald died this year on the ides of January. He was bishop thirty-seven winters, and six months, and fourteen days.</i></p>

 <h2>The problem with names</h2>There are loads of names we encounter and there are a few languages to deal with. I am encountering important place names in French, German, Italian. and English And I'm not even dealing with Polish here! (Hedwig=Jadwiga, Adalbert=Wojciech)
 <pre>
For instance:
German, Fench and English, and sometimes Italian
Thurgau   Thurgovie  Thurgone
Karten    Carinthia
Veneto Venezia
Carniola
Reisenburg Regensberg Ratisbon
Baviare, Bavaria, Bayern
french?  Swabia, Schwaben,
Méranie, Meran
Places that are part of another place:
Vienne is in Provence
Thrugau is in Swabia
Verona is in ?
The names of Dynasties:
The Luitpolding are also refered to as The Babenbergs
Person names
Burchard, Burkhard, Burkhart or even Burkhard
Hedwig, Heilwig?
Henry Heinrich
Arnulf Arnold
Luitpold Leopold
Eberhard Evrard
</pre>

 <p>The next source of the Bertold name lies in either Swabia or Friuli, with the first Bertold metioned in Friuli in 747. The first in Swabia is about 905 mentioned as the uncle of Arnulf "the Bad". The first mention of a Bertold in Bavaria is in 937 when the brother of Arnulf "the Bad" becomes Duke. The name vanishes in Fruili and Swabia before 920, and in Bavaria in 980.</p>

 <p>The name returns to notariaty in Bavaria as the Count of Andechs in around 1100, until the last of the line was Bertold VII, Patriarch of Aquileia who died in 1251.</p>

 <p>The name also returns to Swabia before 1000, and becomes the Zahringen line, which also eventually vanishes with Bertold V, who died childless in 1218.</p>

 <p>But all is not lost... the name reappears amoung the counts of Henneberg, a city and province within Thuringia, part of Franconia.</p>

 <h3>Let's look first at the short list of Friulians...</h3>
 <pre>
Bertold (I) of Friuli (747 - 802)
Chadaloh (I) Duke of Friuli (770 - 819)
Bertold (II) of Friuli (795 - 826)
Chadaloh (II) of Friuli (820 - 875)
Bertold (III) Count of Swabia (842 - 910)
</pre>Nothing is really known about this line, except that it is certain that Chadaloh was a Duke of Friuli, but it is not known for how long. Chadaloh was certainly not Duke prior to 774, when Charlemagne conquered the Langobard kingdom, he was only four years old, but was Bertold? It is possible that, although Charlemagne conquered Pavia, and conquered the kingdom, Friuli may have retained their local Duke until after 810. It is also possible that Bertold came to Italy with Charlemagne, and was made Duke by him.

 <p>All that we really know is that sources tell us that the Margrave of Fruili at that time was Hunroth, a major lord in Charlemagne's acquaintances. Eberhard, the son of Hunroch of Friuli was supposedly born in Northern Gaul (about 810). So Hunroch certainly didn't arrive to take over until after 810. Therefore, Chadaloh was Duke in Friuli, even <i>after</i> Charlemagne conquered the Langobards.</p>

 <p>Clearly the rest of the Bartold/Chadolah's lost the chance at the title, but somehow Bertold (III) ended up a rich man in Swabia.</p>

 <p>For me the question remains. Was Chadaloh (1) a Langobard, who was deposed because Charlemagne conquered them, or (2) made Duke by Charlemagne tempoarily, until Hunroch replaced him.</p>

 <h3>Let's look at another short list of Friulians...</h3>
 <pre>
To Judith (I):
Berenger (the East Frank) (abt. 730 - ?)
Hunroch of Lombardy, Count of Ternios, Margrave of Friuli (abt. 765 - 840)
Eberhard, Margrave of Friuli (abt. 810 - 16 dec 866) married Gisela (-876)
Judith (I) of Friuli (abt 840 - ?) married Albert of Thurgau
To Judith (II):
Berenger (the East Frank) (abt. 730 - ?)
Hunroch of Lombardy, Count of Ternios, Margrave of Friuli (abt. 765 - 840)
Eberhard, Margrave of Friuli (abt. 810 - 16 dec 866) married Gisela (-876)
Berenger, Margrave of Friuli, King of Italy, Emperor (abt. 850 - 924)
Judith (II) of Friuli (abt. 880-952) married Arnulf the Bad (abt. 880-937)
To Gisela (Eberhard's wife):
Charlemagne
Louis the Pious (778-840) married Judith of Bavaria
Gisela (-876)
</pre>

 <h3>This is what appears to have happened after Friuli</h3>I'd like to show how it appears to me. I believe that Bertold (from Friuli) was a progenitor for every Bertold we find in the early noble houses in Swabia (the von Zahringens) and Bavaria (the von Babenbergs and the von Andechs), and eventually these two houses gave rise to the Bertolds who appear in Thuringia (the von Hennebergs). I would like to claim that he is the ancestor of ever Bertold alive today.

 <h3>The First Bertolds of Swabia and Bavaria (860-920).</h3>The first Bertold in Swabia (from Friuli) appears to have arrived in Swabia around 860, married, and had at least three children. Erchanger, Bertold and their sister Kunegunda, Kunegunda's father is mentioned as either Bertold or Erchanger, and her mother was supposedly Gisela, daugter of Emperor Louis II.

 <p><b>Note:</b> I have seen it listed that Kunegunda's parents were Gisela and Erchanger, but the father's name is unlikely. The only other occurance of Erchanger that I have seen (in any genealogy) is Gisela's grandfather on her mother's side. Since Kunegunda's brothers are named Erchanger and Bertold, it makes more sense that her father was named Bertold.</p>

 <p>Although the Bertold name has not yet vanished from Swabian history, it moves quickly to Bavaria.</p>

 <p>Kunegunda married Luitpold of Bavaria sometime <i>before</i> 890, since their son Arnulf becomes Duke in 907, when Luitpold is killed in battle. Luitpold was Count of Nordgau, Duke of Carinthia and Duke of Bavaria (from 889), although he dies in battle against the Magyars. Arnulf must be at least 12 to take over, although it's more likely he was even older, so he was clear born before 895. Luitpold and Kunegunda's second son is named Bertold, again supporting the notion that her father was named Bertold. They do not have a son named Erchanger. Although, it is quite possible that Luitpold and Kunegunda had more children, that are not mentioned.</p>

 <p>In the chronicles of Reisensburg, it says that it is very likely that Kunegunda brought the Reisenburg with her to Bavaria as a wedding present. Now the Reisensburg was even then an ancient castle, likely the first in Germany. If Kunegunda brought it as a present, her parents must have been wealthy. The Reisensburg is located somewhat closer to Regensburg than it is to the Hohentwiel.</p>

 <p>After Luitpold died, Kunegunda then married in 913 to Conrad, King of the Germans (from 911-918). They had at least one chld, so it is likely that Kunegunda was mot much more than 40 then, born after 870, rather than before. Supposing she was born in 873, Bertold (III) was 31 years old when she was born, and she was 40 When she married King Conrad. If Arnulf was born in 890, she was 17 when he was born, and he was 17 when he took over as Duke.</p>

 <p>Another point supporting Kunegunda's noble lineage: If Kunegunda was able to marry the Duke of Bavaria, and later the King of Germany, who both should have been very concerened with bloodlines, she must have been the daughter of someone more important than a local Swabian Count Bertold. So in my estimation, her mom must have been a royal, and it seems to point to Gisela.</p>

 <h3>A couple more Friulians to set the stage</h3>
 <pre>
Judith of Friuli, a daughter of Eberhard of Friuli,
married Adalbert (abt. 840 - 6.6.905) Count of Thurgau, thus moving to Swabia,
and they have a son, Burchard of Swabia (-911).
It is recorded that Gisela, wife of Eberhard  (Judith's mom) was the
grandmother of Burchard of Swabia who died in 911.
</pre>This Burchard evidently has a son Burchard (885 - 926) who becomes Duke of Swabia in 917. <b>Note:</b> However, Judith first married Conrad II (abt 840 - 876), count of Auxerre. Conrad was possibly the father of Rudolf I King of Burgundy (888-912), and grandfather of Rudolf II King (912-937), who becomes important later.

 <p>Eberhard of Friuli was clearly <b>very</b> rich, and he also held lands in Swabia. He is also mentioned as Count of Sulichgau (where is that?).</p>

 <h3>The stage is set. Now for the Chronology</h3><b>905</b> Berenger of Friuli, who was initially crowned king of Italy in 888, but was forced aside, vanquishes Louis II of Provence, blinding him (Louis the Blind), and becomes king again.

 <p><b>906</b> Magyar/Hungarians invade Swabia.</p>

 <p><b>907</b> Kunegunda's husband, Luitpold of Bavaria, dies in battle of Pressburg against the Magyars (Hungarians). Many nobles and priest of Bavaria are killed. Arnold becoms Duke of Bavaria.</p>

 <p><b>910</b> Kunegunda's father, Bertold of Swabia, dies in 910, and his sons Erchanger and Bertold rise to command the armies of Swabia.</p>

 <p><b>911</b> King Louis the Child dies, the last of Charlemagne's line. Who will now be king? Conrad is crowned King of the Franconians, however Arnulf Duke of Bavaria and his uncles in Swabia, object to his rule. Also, Judith of Friuli's son, Burchard Count of Swabia dies, bringing his son Burchard II into his inheritence.</p>

 <p><b>912</b> Erchanger and Bertold begin construction of their castle in Hohentwiel (on Lake Constance).</p>

 <p><b>913</b> Conrad marries Kunegunda, Arnulf's mother in 913. The then young, Arnulf "the Bad" (bef. 890 - 937), son of Luitpold and Cunegunda, succeeds in repelling the Magyars in 913 with the help of his uncles Erchanger and Bertold the "dukes" of Swabia, and his son Luitpold. The Swabians and the Bavarians fight and win a major battle against the Magyars at Inn.</p>

 <p><b>915</b> Arnulf marries a girl from his granfather Bertold's "home town", Judith of Friuli, the daughter of King Berengar. Kunegunda's brothers Erchanger and Bertold do battle with Conrad's troop near Stokach, defeating them. Erchanger of Swabia is elected Duke of Swabia by the Swabians. Berenger is crowned Emperor in Rome.</p>

 <p><b>917</b> Arnulf (whose father-in-law has just become Emperor in Italy), supports his uncles against Conrad, and when Conrad returns, he is defeated along with them. Although Arnulf temporarily goes into hiding, he is not deposed by Conrad (his step father). His uncles, on the other hand, are executed. Burchard II, who is actually the grandson of Berenger's sister Judith and thus Arnulf's first cousin, becomes Duke of Swabia.</p>

 <p><b>918</b> Conrad dies, leaving no King in the east, but nominating Henry the Saxon to follow him. Eberhard (from where?) becomes Duke of Franconia.</p>

 <p><b>919</b> Herny the Saxon is chosen as king of the Franks and the Saxons. Meanwhile, Arnulf of Bavaria is chosen as anti-king by the other Dukes. Henry goes to Swabia, and Burchard switches to support Henry. Burchard is also faced with the challenge of invasion by Rudolf I, king of Burgundy. The Swabians successfully repulse the invaders and the peace that followed is sealed by the marriage of Rudolf to Burchard's daughter. <b>Note:</b> they were both grandsons of Judith (I) of Friuli by seperate fathers.</p>

 <p><b>921</b> King Henry battles Anti-King Arnulf. Henry subjugates Arnulf, but only after Arnulf gains a form of independence for Bavaria.</p>

 <p><b>922</b> King Rudolf II of Burgandy is summoned to Italy to depose Berengar (his grandmother's brother!). Burchard goes with him, the two forming an alliance. They also begin other expeditions of conquest in Italy about 922.</p>

 <p><b>923</b> Rudolf defeats Berenger near Fiorenzuola, and becomes king of Italy. <b>Note:</b> Rudolf is also chosen as anti-king by the West-Franks.</p>

 <p><b>924</b> Berengar is murdered in Verona (city in Friuli).</p>

 <p><b>926</b> Burchard dies during one of their forrays into Italy, and his ally Rudolf, returns to press his claim to Swabia through marriage.</p>

 <p><b>928</b> Henry was unwilling to see Swabia alienated from the kingdom and instead appoints as duke, Hermann, cousin of Eberhard the Franconian Duke. Italy is taken from Rudolf and given to to Hugh of Provence, son of Louis the Blind, who has just died. Meanwhile, to assuage Rudolf's ambitions, the town of Basel was severed from Swabia and given to Burgundy. In gratitude, Rudolf presents Henry with an artifact recovered from Italy - the Holy Lance, an important symbol of the inheritance of Constantine. In response, Provence is also joined to Burgundy when Hugh of Provence dies in 933.</p>

 <h3>But I Digress.</h3>I would like to continue the timeline as a backdrop to the Bertold line, but this is no longer just a story of the Bertold line in Swabia and Bavaria, It becomes a story of their relatives, the royals of Europe. In addition, that story gets even more complex from here on, so let's get back to the basics.

 <p>Luitpold, Duke of Bavaria (bef. 880 - asc. 889 - 4 jul 907) married Cunigunda (867 - ?). Bertold, count of Swabia was the father of Cunigunda. Arnulf "the Bad" ( - 937) was the son of Luitpold and Cunegunda. Arnulf's son Eberhard then followed as Duke until 938.</p>

 <p>Here I have a problem with sources.</p>

 <p>(1) Arnulf's brother Bertold was made duke, when Eberhard died in 938 (he was only duke for one year). Bertold was Duke of Bavaria 938-947 and Duke of Carinthia 927-947. Because of the revolt of the dukes in 939, Otto's brother Henry was made Duke of Bavaria in 947 when Duke Bertold died, rather than another of Arnulf's direct kin. Bertold (-948), Duke of Carinthia and Bavaria was second son of Luitpold. Wiltrud (-990), Duchess of Bavaria, did not remarry after his death. Henry I (-955) Duke of Bavaria (947-955) was the second son of King Henry I, and was married to Judith, the daughter of Arnulf "the Bad". Henry died in 955, possibly during the Magyar battles. He was the brother of King Otto I, and the father of Henry II.</p>

 <p>Henry's son Henry (951-995) "the Quarrelsome" was then named Duke in 955, but he was only four years old. Also in 955, Arnulf's son Bertold was exiled to the Reisensburg, it is said for betraying the Bavarian armies to the Hungarian invaders. Is it possible that he opposed his brother-in-law Henry as Duke? It is not unlikely.</p>

 <p>Henry II (951-995) "the Quarelsome" was twice duke of Bavaria, initally (955-976) under the regency of his mother Judith, and again (985-995) after his brother Henry "the younger" (983-985), who gave the title back to him. He was the father of King Henry II (1002-1024). Otto II became king in 973, and Henry II Duke was deprived of his Duchy by Otto (his cousin) in 976. His name "the Quarrelsome" derives from this era. From 976-982 the Duchy of Bavaria was controlled by Otto II King (973-983). In 976 Otto also granted Herny's uncles Luitpold and Bertold the East March and Carinthia. Thus Bertold was brought back from exile.</p>

</pre>
 <pre>

Hunroch apparently became Duke in 811 or 819, deposing the current Duke, Chadolah.
<br />

Gisela was sister to the Emperors Charles the Bald and Lothar I,
and her son Berengar became king in Italy and even Emperor himself.
<br />

Berengar II, grandson of the Frankish Emperor Berengar I, succeeded a relative of his, Lothaire, as king of Italy in 950. When
Berengar sided against the Lombard Queen Adelaide, Otto I, King of Germany, defeated Berengar, married Adelaide, and added
Italy to his realm.

ANDECHS, Bertoldo di, o di Merania, patriarca d’Aquileia dal 1218 al 1251 (Andechs,
 Carniola, odierna Slovenia 1180 c. - Aquileia 1251). Zio di santa Elisabetta di Turingia.
 Vescovo di Kalocsa (Ungheria), fu eletto patriarca di Aquileia da Onorio III nel 1218. Prese
 parte al concilio di Lione del 1245. Ghibellino, portň a grande splendore il Patriarcato e ne
 estese il dominio, effettivo e non solo nominale, anche sull’Istria. Fu il primo patriarca a
 stabilire la residenza permanente a Udine.
<br />

 Cfr.: Mar. 939; DBI IX, 577-580; R. Muner, Le zecche e le monete dei patriarchi di
 Aquileia, SN I-II, 1969.
<br />

The early Bertold Nobles in the south was quite short lived, and it is difficult to determine
what happened to them after they lost their titles. But I have tried to put together a reasonable
hypothetical history. The reason is that the noble houses of Friuli, Swabia and Bavaria are tied
closely together at the end of the first milenia, but all ended badly.
<br />

The first Bertold appears in Friuli, and the name Bertold seems to be carried along from
generation to generation, although it may skip one here and there.
</pre>
 <pre>

Bertold (I) of Friuli (747 - 802).
Chadaloh (I) Duke of Friuli (770 - 819).
Bertold (II) of Friuli (795 - 826).
Chadaloh (II) of Friuli (820 - 875).
Bertold (III) (842 - 910).
</pre>
 <pre>

I have not discovered if they were Dukes, but it is possible. Charlemagne conquered the
langobard kingdom in 774, and it is likely that Bertold (I), wherever he came from, had been in control
prior to that.
<br />

Charlemagne brought his friend Hunroch from North Gaul to be the new Duke of Friuli,
but when did the Bertold/Chadaloh line moved to Swabia?
It seems not until Bertold III, and my guess is not until 866, after Eberhard died.
Perhaps he went with one of Eberhard's sons to inspect the lands that
he inherited from Eberhard.
<br />

One of the real questions that still face me is who was Bertold (III)'s wife?
They had at least three children, Bertold, Kunigunda and Erchanger. Now Erchanger appears
to be a very unusual name, and the only other occurance I have seen is the father of Engleberg,
the wife of Louis II (-875). They did have a daughter Gisela?
The Margraves of Friuli, Tuscany, and Spoleto became stronger in these frontier territories,
especially because of Avar/Hungarian incursions in 791-796.
But Eberhard (800/810 - 16 dec 866), the Next Duke was supposedly born before Hunroch, duke in Friuli moved to Friuli.
A lot is known about Eberhard because of his will. He was VERY rich.
He Married GISELA, Princess of France. And among his children were Berenger, King of Italy,
and his granddaughter Judith of Friuli married Arnulf "The Bad", the anti-king of Bavaria.
In 866 Berengar had become Margrave of Friuli.
Continuing, Berengar was crowned king of Italy in 888, after the death of Charles III.
He was initally forced aside by Guido (891-894) and Lambert (892-892) dukes of Spoleto who forced the
pope to crown them as emperors.
Enter Arnulf of Carinthia (son of Carolman, not "the Bad"), who was recognized as king in 887 by the various German states,
and crowned Emperor in 896. However he returned north, and died in 899.
After the death of Lambert in 900, Loius of Provence was crowned king, and Emperor Louis III in 901.
But Berengar subjugated him in 905, and blinded him (thus Louis the Blind).
Berengar was finally crownded Emperor in 915, and reigned until King Rudolf of Burgandy removed him in 922.
Berenger was murdered in 924.
<br />

The first link from Fruili comes in the form of a question. It appears that Bertold (III) of Fruili
became Bertold (I) of Swabia. Exacly how this happened I don't know, but there was no Duchy at that time,
and we only have the fact that Bertold's sons Erchanger and Bertold became the first Dukes of Swabia.
<br />

But let us look at these early Bertold's in Swabia.
<br />

In the Catholic Encyclopedia listing for Arnulf, the son of Arnulf "the Bad" we find:
The Magyars were finally defeated in a battle on the Inn not far from Passau, in the year 913, by a combined
army of the Bavarians under Arnulf and of the Swabians under Erchanger and Bertold, who were the brothers of Arnulf's
mother Kunigunde.
<br />

Kunigunde married Conrad I, King of Franconia (911-918)
<br />

In the history of Swabia we find:
"Alemannia's forces raised its commander, Erchanger, to the dukedom in 915,
after his forces defeated the German king Conrad I."
<br />

But ultimately when Erchanger was defeated and executed in 917, he was replaced by Burchard II.
Burchard was the grandson of Judith (I) of Friuli.
<br />

Luitpold ruled Bavaria until 907, abd then his son Arnulf took over.
Arnulf's brother Bertold of Bavaria (- 23 nov 947)
was made Duke of Carinthia in 927, probably by Arnulf.
Arnulf died in 937, and his son-in-law Henry became Duke.
<br />

Henry, the son of Bertold (son of Arnulf) was Duke of Carinthia (976-978).
Next in line was a Frederic
and then a whole hereditary string of Bertolds, but no record after the sixth.
</pre>
 <pre>

Luitpold (- 5 jul 907) married Cunegunda of Swabia (sister of Bartold and Erchanger)
Here it is difficult to determine if Cunegunda, Bertold, and Erchanger were the children of
another Erchanger, or or another Bertold. It seems likely that they are the children of
Bertold of Friuli, given the dates, and the subsequent ties between Friuli and Bavaria.

M Borgolte *Die Grafen Alemanniens in merowingischer und karolingischer Zeit: Eine Prosopographie* (Sigmaringen: Thorbecke, 1986)
Kunegund's brothers are counts Erchanger (II) (pp.110-11) and Bertold (V) (pp.81-82).
Their father was the count palatine Bertold
Borgolte thinks this is the count palatine Bertold (IV) (pp.79-80).
Bertold (IV)'s ancestral line is not known, but there is a
consensus that he belongs to the Alaholfing family group. The
genealogical table setting out the relationships and possible
relationships of the early members of this family group can be found in

After the death of Charles III, Margrave Berengar of Friuli was crowned King of Italy in 888.
In 894, Arnulf of Carinthia was recognized as king and crowned emperor in 896, however he returned to
Bavaria.

This last Bertold (whether the Iv or the VI, who died in 1204, was the last of this Bertold line.
Eight children were born to Bertold IV, Count of Andechs and Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia. Four sons and four daughters.
Two of the sons became bishops, Ekbert of Bamberg, and
Bertold (- 1251) bishop of Kalocsa (1206) Patriarch of Aguileia (1218).
Otto succeeded his father as Duke of Dalmatia, and Heinrich became Margrave
of Istria.
Saint Hedwig, Duchess of Silesia (1174 - 15 Oct 1243).
Her three sisters, Gertrude married Andrew II, King of Hungary, from which union sprang St. Elizabeth,
Landgravine of Thuringia; Mechtilde became Abbess of Kitzingen; while Agnes was made the unlawful wife of Philip II of
France in 1196.

After the Staufens, the Bertolds were the most prominent family of
castlebuilders in Swabia.  This family drew their early power and tax
base from their control of monasteries, which they founded in the
hitherto-uninhabited Black Forest.  Once developed by monks, it began to
be colonized and towns laid out, including Freiburg-im-Breisgau, founded
by Conrad Bertold in 1120.  By then, the castle had become so important
that their owners began to name themselves after them, so it is as
Conrad von Zähringen that Conrad appears in the records.

Here the Zahringen line vanishes.
</pre>
 <pre>

According to legend, Bern was founded in 1191, by Duke Bertold V of
Zahringen.  He was quite the hunter, and decided to name the city after
the first animal he killed.  He killed a bear.  Bears have been the
mascot of the city ever since, and have been kept in bear pits for the
past 500 or so years.
<br />

The Duchy of Zähringen (1120-1218)
<br />

Freiburg was founded in the year 1120, as Duke Bertold III and his
brother Konrad II sealed the deed confirming market rights.  The site
was chosen because the duchy already posessed a castle above Freiburg
and it being situated on an existing east west trading route.  Rich
reserves of silver from the Schauinsland, the mountain overlooking
Freiburg, guaranteed prosperity which in 1200 allowed the start of
construction of the cathedral.
<br />

Order of the Lion of Zähringen (Orden der Loewen von Zähringen).
Established by the Grand Duke Charles Louis Frederick 26.12.1812.
<br />

Order of Bertold of Zähringen (Orden Bertolds I von Zähringen).
Established by the Grand Duke Frederick 24.4.1877 as a superior class of
the Order of the Lion of Zähringen.
<br />

So apparently Bertold I built the castle "Zahringen" on the place where
Bertold III later built Freiburg?????

Pope Steven V wanted Arnulf, the Eastern Frankish King, to come and
claim the Italian crown and with it the Imperial crown as well, but
because of Danish attacks he couldn't.  So instead, Steven gave it to
Guido of Spoleto.  In 905, the Pope gave it to Berengar, who ruled as
king in Italy alone after Guido's death.  When Berengar died in 924, the
Frankish Empire died with him.  The next to be crowned emperor by the
Pope was Otto I, the German king, thus starting the Holy Roman Empire
which lasted until 1802.

could this be Bertold from Graisbach? decended from Diepold of Vohburg? he's the right age
In any case, it looks like it turns out to be a long line... lasting centuries.
Graisbach, Vohburg and Bogen are all near Regensburg, in Nordgau, and
were clearly owned by one of the Bertold lines in Bavaria.
<br />

However, hohenburg is also close to regensburg and that's apparently a zahringer offshoot!
