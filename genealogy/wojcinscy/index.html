<h2>Marcin Wojcinski and Franciszka Szyszka</h2>
<p />
<p>Marcin was born in Marlewo, near Poznań in 1856. Marcin first married Marianna Jaskolska in Poland in 1879 before coming to America.
I know that Marcin and Marianna lived in Pennsylvania for some years before moving to Detroit in 1889 or 1890. Their eldest living daughter, Mary, was born there in 1888.
<p>After moving to Detroit, Marcin and Marianna settled near what is now Sweetest Heart of Mary church, and even lived on the block where it was being built.
We know that they had two sons in Detroit: Joseph and Wladislaw.
Now it gets cokmplicated.
It is said that Marianna died in childbirth, but I have been unable to find any record of her death.
Wladislaw was born in December of 1891.
Marcin was supposedly also the father of Leocadia who was supposed to have been born in December of 1892.
Marcin married Franciszka in 1893, so was Marianna Leocadia's mother, or was Franciszka? Since there is no record of her birth, it's difficult to know. There is a record of the birth of Michael in September of 1893, which makes it unlikely that Michael and Leocadia had the same mother.
This question may never be answered, since many records from the late 1880s and early 1890s appear to be missing in Detroit.
<p>In 1893 Marcin married Franciszka, whose family name I am unsure of. On some documents she is listed as Szyszka, while on others she appears as Jankowska.
<p>On her son Frank's marriage record, his mother is Frances Szyszkowa.
<p>On her son Edward's marrriage record, his mother is  Frances Jankowska.
<p>etc.
<p>
I have heard that she was running away from Poland, and may have been trying to hide her identity. She was supposed to have been pregnant when she left. Although I am uncertain when she arrived, or where she came from, I have papers where she claimed to have arrived in 1888, when she was 16 years old. We have no record of whether she had a child at that time.
The first record of her in Detroit is from the birth of Michael (who died a short time later), just weeks before she and Marcin married in 1893.
Was Michael conceived in Poland and born in America? I'm still looking for clues. On her "Alien Registration" papers, Franciszka claims to have arrived in 1888, and was born in 1872 in Rypin, Poland. That means she would have been sixteen years old and travelling alone, which seems unlikely. If true, she should have had a child in 1888 or 1889, but I have no record of that yet.
It makes more sense that she was pregnant with Michael when she arrived in 1893, as a 21 year old.
<p>Interesting side note: Marcin and Franciszka were married by father Dominic Hippolytus Kolasinski at Sacred Heart of Mary church in 1893, which was not part of the Roman Catholic Diocese at the time. Father Kolasinski had been ex-communicated by Bishop Borgess, and was not re-admitted until February of 1894 by Bishop Foley.  At the time the church was admitted to the Diocese, it was renamed Sweetest Heart of Mary.
<p>Since there is no birth record for Lilly, it is difficult to know who her mother was. She grew up knowing only Franciszka, so it makes sense to assume she was her mother. But the dates don't appear to work.

<p>Martin died in 1909 is an accident at work. Martin's death certificate states that he had sixteen children, but only eight living.

<p>Martin's eight known living children were:
<ul>
<li> Mary (1888) married John Wisniewski (1882-1934). They had Joseph (1909-1928), Mary (1910-1933), Helen (1912), Leonard (1913), Raymond (1916), and Irene (1918).
<li> Joseph (1890-1968) married (1914) Martha Litzan (1889). They had Dorothy (1916) and Joseph Jr. (1919). They changed the family name to Walters between 1920 and 1930.
<li> Ladyslaus (1891) is a complete mystery. We have no info on him past 1910.
<li> Leocadia (1892-1981) went by Lillian and married (1911) Frank Kochanski (1886). They had Eleanor (1913), Alvin or Albin (1916-1975), and Frank Jr. (1920).
<li> Rose (1894-1971) married (1911) Waclaw Bartold (1886-1960). They had Emily (1912-1986), Chester (1915-1979), Mitchell (1918-2008), and Norbert (1928-2008).
<li> Frank (1898-1967) married (1921) Francis Novak (1901-1972). They had Robert (1923), Virginia (1925), and Wilbert (1932).
<li> Edward (1903) married (1922) Anna Budzinska (1903). They had Raymond (1924),  Leonard (1925), Delphine (1926), Ralph (1932), and Barbara (1935).
<li> Leonard (1906-1974) married Theresa (1907-1974). They had Alice (1928),  Gerald (1932), and Leona (1934).
</ul>

<p>We know about at least 4 children that did not survive. Michael born in 1893, John in 1901, an unnamed boy in 1903 and an unnamed girl in 1908.
<p>Martin was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Detroit. It is also known as Sacred Heart of Mary Cemetery, because it was established by Father Kolisinski for the church they built: Sacred Hart of Mary. The church changed its name in 1894 to Sweetest Heart of Mary, but the cemetary retained the old name.
Martin and Marianna, along with the children who died were buried there, but all of their graves are lost, mainly because records were destroyed in 1989, and also becuase they were buried in a low lying part of the cemetery which was later covered by about 3 feet of soil.

<p>Looking at the children from 1891 to 1894, we have:
<ul>
<li>Wladislaw born 1891-12-26, but no birth record has been found.
<li>Leokadia born 1892-12-11, but no birth record has been found.
<li>Michael born 1893-09-01, parents are listed as Francis and Martin Wocinski.
<li>Rozalia born 1894-09-15, parents are listed as Francis and Martin Wirskinski.
</ul>
<p>Wlad was definitely Marianna's son, and Rose was definitely Franciszka's daughter. Between them Lilly and Michael were born.
<p>Lilly registered as an Alien in 1940, where she states she was born in Detroit 11 December 1892. Although born in Detroit, she lost her citizenship when she married Frank Kochanski, from Poland in 1911. She became a citizen again in 1941.
<p>
The time between Lilly and Michael is less than 9 months, so it seems likely that Lilly was Marianna's daughter, while Michael was Franciszka's son.
So, most likely, Leokadia was Marianna's daughter, and Marianna died giving birth to her.
However, this is contrary to what was claimed in the 1910 census. Lilly is listed as Franciszka's daughter, even though Joe and Wlad are lister as foster children.
If Marianna died in childbirth, it should be posssible to find her death in December of 1892. Unfortunately, my searches have turned up nothing.
Michael was probably Franciszka's son. If word of mouth is to be trusted, Michael was conceived in Poland and born in America, which means that Franciszka should have arrived in 1893.
Also, it makes more sense that if Franciszka left Poland in 1893, she would have been 21 years old at the time.

<p>The mystery of Wladislaus remains, but we do have some possible clues. Wladyslaw may have changed his name to Walter. In the 1910 Detroit City directoy Jos and Walter are listed at 363 Garfield, along with Frances (wid Matthew). This was the Wojcinski home at the time. In 1911 Walter is no longer listed, but, side note, "Waclaus Bartold" is: he may have moved in afther Martin's death when Franciszka started taking on boarders to help with expenses.
There is a Walter Wojcinski who was born in Detroit in 1891 who enlisted in the army on April 4 in 1911, and as discharged with a disability on July 1st of the same year.
He registered for the draft on June 5 in 1917, listing his birth date as 14 December 1891. On that card it lists his occupation as Sailor. So Wlad may have become Walter the Sailor.
<p>I am still looking for when Marcin came to America. We know that Marcin and Marianna married in 1879, and that Mary was born in Pennsylvania in 1888. That leaves a lot of years without children. There is a ship arrival in Baltimore in 1883 with Michael (4) and Józefa (11 months), with Marianna and "Warzyn" Wojczinski. It is possible that this was Marcin, badly pronunced, and both Michael and Józefa died in Pennsylvania. That would still leave 2 of Marcin's non-survivingchildren unaccounted for. It's poosible that we'll find two more births in Pennsylvania between 1884 and 1887. The search continues...

  <p>I've included a printout of the family, with all the data I have from myheritage.com.
