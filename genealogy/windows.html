  <h2 class="center">Working with Polish/Central European Accents in Windows</h2>

 <h3>Task 1: Adding Multi-lingual capabilities (5 Steps):</h3>The first step in using Windows 98 (or Windows 95) with international accented characters is making sure you have installed/enabled Multi-Lingual capabilities. There were lots of solutions for Windows 3.1 out there, but none of them work well with the newer operating systems. Some of the third party software available is probably worth looking at, but I have found the "native" fonts and keyboards to work best in the majority of situations.

 <p>Step 1: adding multi-lingual fonts</p>

 <ul>
  <li>click on "start" - "settings" - "control panel".</li>

  <li>then double-click on "add/remove programs".</li>

  <li>click the "windows setup" tab.</li>

  <li>scroll down to "multi-language support".</li>

  <li>double click it to get the language selection menu.</li>

  <li>if there is no check mark, click on "central european" to add it.</li>

  <li>click OK.</li>

  <li>click OK again, and it should add the language support.</li>
 </ul>Step 2: adding the polish keyboard mapping (similar for other "CE" languages)

 <ul>
  <li>again "start" - "settings" - "control panel".</li>

  <li>double-click on "keyboard".</li>

  <li>select the "language" tab. (make sure there is a check by "enable indicator on taskbar" the last line in that window)</li>

  <li>click the "add" button (middle of the window).</li>

  <li>a little language pop-up appears... scroll down to the language you want to add: e.g. "Polish".</li>

  <li>hit Ok to close the pop-up.</li>

  <li>There should now be English and Polish in the Language box.</li>

  <li>Highlight "Polish".</li>

  <li>then click the "properties" button to select a different layout. (another pop-up).</li>

  <li>select "Polish (programmers)" (for how to use it, see Step 5 below).</li>

  <li>Click the OK button.</li>

  <li>(Note which key-combo is selected for switching between languages: [alt]+[shift] by default)</li>

  <li>Click OK again.</li>
 </ul>Step 3: switching keyboards

 <ul>
  <li>Now, at the bottom right of your screen (next to the clock) you should now have a "En" indicator, indicating that you are using the english keyboard.</li>

  <li>Press [alt]+[shift] together to make it change to "Pl"</li>
 </ul>

 <ul>
  <li>Press [alt]+[shift] together again to make it change back to "En"</li>

  <li style="list-style: none">Step 4: selecting fonts</li>
 </ul>

 <ul>
  <li>You will be able to use the Central European versions of Times, Courier and Arial without further ado. If you want more fonts go to the microsoft fonts page and select other multi-lingual fonts to download. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/default.htm</a></li>
 </ul>Step 5: check it out

 <ul>
  <li>Press [alt]+[shift] together again switch to the "Pl" Keyboard mapping.</li>

  <li>Go to Word (if you have it) and type in [ctrl]+[alt]+c (or type ~c) and you should get a lower case "c" with accent. If you get a cirlce-c, you are using the english keyboard, or a font that is not multi-lingual. Not all fonts are multi-lingual, but there are a lot to choose from. (see step 4 above)</li>

  <li><b>How to type the letters</b>: In order to type polish accented letters with a physical english keyboard, the "Polish (Programmers)" keyboard mapping enables two methods (both commonly used in Poland).</li>

  <li><b>By Key Combo</b>: simultaneously type [ctrl]+[alt]+(letter) where (letter) is one of: a, c, e, l, o, n, s, z, or x for the appropriate accented letter. [ctrl]+[alt]+[shift]+(letter) gives the upper case accented letter. <b>Note:</b> There are some programs or computers where not every key combo will work. e.g. on HP Pavilion systems, the key combo "[ctrl]+[alt]+s" will produce a "support info box". I talked to HP about this, and they say it is coded into the hardware, and that's just the way it is. In Family Tree Maker, a [ctrl]+[alt]+c will compress the database, and I don't know how to turn that off.</li>

  <li><b>Using "tilde"</b>: Another common way to type accented letters is by typing the tilde (~) key, followed by a letter that you want accented. This is not normally activated on english keyboards, but with the Polish keyboard mapping (this one included), typing a single tilde key will not produce any visible character. If one follows the tilde with any of the accentible letters, it will produce the properly accented letter. If you type tilde followed by any other letter, it will produce the tilde followed by that letter (or number etc.). If you type tilde followed by space, it will just produce the tilde. <b>Note</b>: Using tilde works for every letter with every program and computer I've tried this with, so this is probably the better method to use.</li>

  <li><b>Note</b>: There are two accented z's in Polish, with a dot above or with an accent mark above. The z-dot is created by using the z key, the less common z-accent is created with the x key.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Task 2: Getting old style programs to acknowledge Central European Fonts.</h3>The main problem is that although one can type polish letters very easily under Windows 95 or Windows 98, FTM and other "older" programs refuse to display them as polish accented letters. Word for Windows, WordPerfect, Netscape, Explorer, etc. etc. work fine with displaying the letters.

 <p>Before you start, you will need to activate/install multi-lingual capabilities in Windows. In case you don't know how, see task 1 above.</p>

 <p>Now you will need to modify your WIN.INI file.</p>

 <p>The first step in displaying the Central European letters is making FTM and other Windows based programs think that there is a special Central European font on the computer, when there really isn't. The Central European accented letters are contained in the standard Windows multi-lingual fonts. Unfortunately, older programs just don't know how to find them. So here's how to make them find them. I've never received a good explanation of why this works, but it does.</p>

 <p>This info came from a company called "Young Digital Poland" who market a super Polish &lt;-&gt; English Dictionary in conjunction with Harper Collins.</p>

 <p>Adding the following entries to the C:\WINDOWS\WIN.INI file are necessary for the ability to display Central European accented letters:</p>
 <pre>
[FontSubstitutes]
Arial CE,238=Arial,238
Courier New CE,238=Courier New,238
Times New Roman CE,238=Times New Roman,238
Arial CE,0=Arial,238
Courier New CE,0=Courier New,238
Times New Roman CE,0=Times New Roman,238
</pre>At this point you should restart windows, so that it will know what "Arial CE" refers to.

 <h3>Task 3: Getting Family Tree Maker to Display Polish Accented Letters</h3>Since I have never gotten an answer to my questions about being able to <b>DISPLAY</b> Central European Accented letters in FTM 5, I have struggled with it on my own. Adding the "Central European" fonts to Windows was the first big step (task 2 above).

 <blockquote>
  "Family Tree Maker is not designed or tested to run in modes other than in the English version of Windows and keyboards. If the character is not available in Character Map with the standard fonts, then it can't be entered into Family Tree Maker." - Paul Burchfield, The Learning Company (21 Feb 1999).
 </blockquote>I haven't got a perfect solution, but here's an almost complete solution.

 <p>Getting the fonts to work on the Family Page is is the most important part. Having them display properly on the reports is fine, but you need to display them on the "FamPg" so you know that what you've typed in is correct!</p>

 <p>FTM does not provide an easy way to change the display font for the FamPg or the Index. To change the font on the FamPg, you need to edit the "FTW.INI" file, which is located in the FTM directory (usually "C:\Program Files\Family Tree Maker\").</p>

 <p>There should be two lines (among others) in the "Options" section of the file that specify the fonts to use on the "FamPg".</p>
 <pre>
[Options]
...
FamPagFont=Arial
TabsFont=Arial
...
</pre>Change these two lines, and these two only, to use the Central European fonts. i.e.:
 <pre>
[Options]
...
FamPagFont=Arial CE
TabsFont=Arial CE
...
</pre>Now you can start up Family Tree Maker, and the "FamPg" will show the proper accented letters as you type them in (make sure you select your polish keyboard first).

 <p>To select the "Central European" fonts on the reports is the really tedious part.</p>

 <p>One needs to select each of the buttons in turn: Journal; Ancestor (Fan and Standard separately), Descend (Fan and Standard), Hrglass (Fan and Standard), GenRpt (see note 2 below), FamGrp, and Report.</p>

 <p>For Each Report, you will need to select "Format" and then "Text Font, Style and Size..." from the menu. That will open up the font selection window. You will need to select each and every item in the "Items to Format" box one by one, and then select the proper font (i.e.. "Times New Roman CE (TT)" or "Arial CE (TT)") in the "Font" box.</p>

 <p>Note 1: There is no possibility of setting the Display Font for the Index selection.</p>

 <p>Note 2: Changing the fonts in the "GenRpt" section seems to have no effect. i.e. the letters are not displayed correctly.</p>

 <p>That's the best I've been able to do so far. I still have no idea how to get the Index to list the central european names correctly, and I have no idea why changing the Fonts in the GenRpt has no effect.</p>

 <p>I would still like to get an answer from the makers of the program, but maybe someone else out there can go further with this?</p>
