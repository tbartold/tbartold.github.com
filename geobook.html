Hi from Germany, from Saxonia. I married last year, so my name is now Berthold, but the father of my husband hasn't much information about his father, the source of our surname. He was "made" during world war II near Chemnitz. I'm very happy to find such large site with informations about the name and I try to get the lost part of the family. When I have an overview I will connect again. Thanks for the first informations. By Annett<br />

Hi.. wow what a page! Tons of information.. it really made me feel so much better. I have been down because I have been searching to no avail for my Berchtold line. In case you or someone else knows something.. they were Joseph Berchtold and Rosina Berctold.. Rosina born October 29, 1859 in Langweid, Germany.. nothing known about Joseph.. they had a daughter Marie born in same place, on Feb. 5, 1887. Documentation shows nothing about Joseph. Family story has it that he was a duke, and that he came to Y looking for daughter to no avail. Apparently, Rosina brought child to CT, USA and left her here, at age 3. Marie, my g. grandmother never knew either parent. Rosina left Residence Certificate with Marie before she left. I would be elated to know if you know anything at all about the Berchtold's of this area and time. Thanks again for all the insight! I am so please to have at least that much information about my missing family! Blessings to you, Roberlie<br />

<strong>Comment :</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Appreciate the valuable historical background. Somewhere along the line before 1747, a "g" was added to the name Berthold to make the Bergthold before 1747. There was a Jacob B. who had a son Daniel, born 1747. His son John (1772) had Jacob (1794)who had Daniel (1821), who had Henry in (1848). Somebody knows the genealogical connection to the previous spellings that are found in "Origins of the Name". That was a tremendous work and labor of love. Response would be appreciated to bridge the gap. LeRoy<br />

This is a very nice web site with plenty of information. It would be nice to know more of Polish culture like food and holidays - maybe Berthold traditions in Poland? Keep up the great work here, love it!<br />

You have done a tremendous amount of work. I thank you very much. Stumbled across the name Bartoldi and that made me interested. Louise Bartoldi *1770. Married my 3rg gr-grandfather in Wildberg, Germany in 1790. Always wondered about the origin. Thank you. Don<br />

I accidently stubbled accross your page, during my research of my family tree. I am very very excited that Bertoldo's had such a long history starting in Fruili, especially as it is my fathers birthplace. Perhaps I'm am a descendant from those same lines. Great stuff.<br />

This was a wonderful site- I learned a lot. My grandfather (born Giovanni Bertoldi in Trent, Italy -1881) immigrated to USA and became John Bartholdi. This was very interesting to learn all the other spellings and countries the family had lived in.<br />

Agnes (Peter's mom) found a spelling error. In your summary of personal history, in the second full paragraph, you typed "and degree" when it should have been "any degree". Otherwise, she was very impressed.<br />
